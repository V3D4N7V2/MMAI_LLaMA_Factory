Write python code for the following task. 
There are audio files inside directories along with transcriptions.
Directories look like.

t_9/
-- negative.txt
-- positive.txt
-- netural.txt
-- label.txt 
t_<could be any number here>/
-- negative.txt
-- positive.txt
-- netural.txt
-- label.txt 
v_<could be any number here>/
-- negative.txt
-- positive.txt
-- netural.txt
-- label.txt 


Read the text files and pass them to openai api. Now create a prompt to ask it to be a therapist. Explain to it what SDS score is, and Then ask it to put the person on the SDS Scale. Each directory represents a person. 

SDS scale is as follows.

The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale was designed by Duke University psychiatrist William W.K. Zung MD (1929–1992) to assess the level of depression for patients diagnosed with depressive disorder.[1]

20–44 Normal Range
45–59 Mildly Depressed
60–69 Moderately Depressed
70 and above Severely Depressed
The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale has been translated into many languages, including Arabic,[2] Azerbaijani,[3] Dutch, German, Portuguese,[4] and Spanish.[5]


Now store the results in the csv in this format. 

<person_name>, <expected SDS Score>, <SDS score predicted by api>
